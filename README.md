# Landing-page
Mini project for coding bootcamp


## Description

- This landing page is meant to serve as a website where someone can enter in their contact information and submit it to the owner
- Throughout this project I learned a lot about different css identifiers and how they affect the appearance of the website in different ways
- I also learned that it is a very tedious process of trial and error to get the desires result, but with more practice and experience I think I can become a skilled developer

## Usage

- The input boxs at the bottom of the page are where the user can enter in their name and email
- They do not really get sent anywhere or get saved, it is just an excersise
